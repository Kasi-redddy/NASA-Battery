Battery Analysis Project - Explanation & Guide
1. Introduction
Battery health prediction is a crucial task in battery management systems. This project
focuses on analyzing battery impedance data, incremental capacity data, and predicting
battery health using machine learning techniques.
2. Data Loading & Preprocessing (Step 1)
Goal: Load and prepare battery dataset for analysis.
â€¢ Libraries Used: pandas, numpy, os, warnings, StandardScaler
â€¢ Actions Taken:
o Loaded CSV files from the NASA battery dataset.
o Inspected a sample file to understand its structure.
o Normalized the data using StandardScaler to ensure uniform feature
scaling.
Why Normalization? Machine learning models perform better when features are on a
similar scale.
3. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS)
Analysis (Step 2)
Goal: Visualize changes in impedance over battery cycles.
â€¢ Libraries Used: matplotlib, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d
â€¢ Key Concept: EIS measures the battery's internal resistance and aging.
â€¢ Visualization: 3D Nyquist plot displaying real vs. imaginary impedance over cycle
counts.
Why EIS? Impedance analysis helps in understanding battery aging and degradation.
4. Incremental Capacity (dQ/dV) Analysis (Step 3)
Goal: Examine incremental capacity changes with aging.
â€¢ Libraries Used: numpy, matplotlib
â€¢ Key Concept: dQ/dV analysis identifies changes in battery charge/discharge
behavior.
â€¢ Visualization: 3D plot showing voltage vs. incremental capacity over battery cycles.
Why dQ/dV? It helps detect early signs of battery degradation.
5. Battery Performance Forecasting (Step 4)
Goal: Predict future battery health trends using an LSTM model.
â€¢ Libraries Used: tensorflow, keras, LSTM, MinMaxScaler
â€¢ Key Concept: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a recurrent neural network useful
for time-series forecasting.
â€¢ Model Structure:
o Two LSTM layers with dropout for regularization.
o Output dense layer for prediction.
o Trained on battery health time-series data.
Why LSTM? It efficiently captures long-term dependencies in sequential data like battery
cycles.
6. Battery Capacity Prediction (Step 5)
Goal: Predict battery capacity using a Gradient Boosting model.
â€¢ Libraries Used: GradientBoostingRegressor, mean_squared_error
â€¢ Key Concept: Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning method that builds
models sequentially, improving errors at each step.
â€¢ Model Structure:
o Trained on cycle count and impedance data.
o Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Why Gradient Boosting? It effectively captures complex patterns in battery capacity data.
7. Model Evaluation & Explainability (Step 6)
Goal: Understand how our machine learning model makes predictions.
â€¢ Libraries Used: SHAP
â€¢ Key Concept: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) helps interpret feature
importance.
â€¢ Visualization: SHAP summary plot showing the most influential battery features.
Why SHAP? It provides transparency on why a model makes certain predictions.
8. Hyperparameter Tuning (Step 7)
Goal: Optimize the Gradient Boosting model for better accuracy.
â€¢ Libraries Used: optuna
â€¢ Key Concept: Bayesian Optimization helps in selecting the best hyperparameters
automatically.
â€¢ Tuned Parameters:
o Number of estimators
o Maximum depth
o Learning rate
Why Hyperparameter Tuning? It improves model performance by selecting the best
combination of settings.
9. Model Comparison (Step 8)
Goal: Compare Gradient Boosting with XGBoost and RandomForest.
â€¢ Libraries Used: XGBRegressor, RandomForestRegressor
â€¢ Comparison Metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
â€¢ Key Insight: Different models provide different levels of accuracy and
interpretability.
Why Compare? Ensures the best-performing model is selected for battery health
prediction.
10. RMSE & MAE Metrics (Step 9)
Goal: Evaluate models using additional performance metrics.
â€¢ Metrics Used:
o RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) â€“ Measures overall error.
o MAE (Mean Absolute Error) â€“ Measures absolute prediction error.
â€¢ Findings: Lower RMSE and MAE indicate better performance.
Why RMSE & MAE? They give a clearer picture of how well the model is predicting battery
capacity.
11. Improved Visualizations (Step 10)
Goal: Enhance SHAP and feature importance visualizations.
â€¢ Libraries Used: seaborn, shap
â€¢ Visualizations:
o SHAP plots to understand feature contributions.
o Feature Importance bar plots to highlight critical variables.
Why Visualization? Makes model interpretation easier for engineers and stakeholders.
